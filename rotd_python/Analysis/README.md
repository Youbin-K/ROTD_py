Once you have run the file using the `example.py` implementing it into the `multi.py` , there will be several (defined by the user) 'surface_#.dat' files that have been created by the user's input. Using this input files, now we will compare with the MD simulation data, by using the `compare_plot_final.ipynb` This file calls out the analysis.py in the rotd_py folder, to calculate the minimum flux.

//To make it easier to test, the 'surface_#.dat' files are added.

//tst_me.out = output file made by Xi Chen, using the python2 version of ROTD
C_surface_data = output file made by running the C++ ROTD
surface_data_v0 = output file made by Youbin Kim, running the 2022 version of ROTD
