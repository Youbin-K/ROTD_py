This is a python package for Variable Reaction Coordinate Transition State Theory
(VRC-TST)

The algorighm for the package is refered to the following literatures:

Georgievskii, Yuri, and Stephen J. Klippenstein. 
"Variable reaction coordinate transition state theory: Analytic results and 
application to the C2H3+Hâ†’ C2H4 reaction." 
The Journal of chemical physics 118.12 (2003): 5442-5455.


Georgievskii, Yuri, and Stephen J. Klippenstein. 
"Transition state theory for multichannel addition reactions: Multifaceted 
dividing surfaces." 
The Journal of Physical Chemistry A 107.46 (2003): 9776-9781.

Starting from the example.py, submit by using the submit.sh in CCV.

To run on local computer, use 
"mpiexec -n 2 python3 example.py"
Here, by chaning the number "2" after -n, cpu core usage can be determined.
When running in local environment, number of dividing surface (written in example.py) is recommended to stay below 3, since it takes a lot of time to run.

Explanations on how the code works are written in each fragment, sample, flux and multi.py file.
